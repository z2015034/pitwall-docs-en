# Threads

## Thread management
Thread functionality serves various purposes in handling events as a team, designed to facilitate communication and collaboration among team members.

These are the fundamentals of thread management:
- Real-time communication: Threads allow team members to focus instantly on specific events to initiate actions.
- Information sharing: Team members can use threads to share the updates and relevant information.
- Adjustment of response methods: Easily accessible data help you adjust action strategies.

### Creating a new Thread
This is the default view of the threads:
